### Homework1, Femicides and Turkish Economy
Femicide rates are increasing steeply in Turkey. It is suspected that this particular increase is caused by two recent trends in Turkey which are decrease in household economy and increase of corruption in justice. Since it is not very feasible to estimate corruption in law, [Here](https://github.com/Han-Droidd/ETM-Projects/blob/main/ETM58D%2C%20Femicides%20and%20The%20Economy.ipynb) is my analysis for establishing a relationship between some economical factors which my influence household income and femicide rates of Turkey.

### Homework2.2, Derived Map of Turkey
I have tried to build an [Algorithm](https://github.com/Han-Droidd/ETM-Projects/blob/main/ETM58D%2C%20Derived%20Map%20of%20Turkey.ipynb) that can derive the map of Turkey by only consuming the distance between districts which is provided by governmental road construction works organization.
